A project by Malte Borgwardt, Jonas Boueke, Mar√≠a Fernanda Sanabria, Michael Bonfert and Robert Porzel.

The Frisbee flying physics are based on the works of Mont Hubbard and Sarah Ann Hummel "Simulation of Frisbee Flight" from 2000, and Sarah Ann Hummel "Frisbee Flight Simulation and Throw Biomechanics" from 2003.
